# DE Strava project

The contest of this repo is a small data engineer project that get data from my own Strava account by Postman API.
After that this raw data is uploaded to S3 bucket and a lambda function act on it to transform a raw json data into a 
edited parquet data. 

My main target was understand how get this data and build up thi ETL using cloud

Strava API was boring and confusing. I made a step-by-step. But any doubts you could contact me or [watch him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgscChKfGyg&list=PLO6KswO64zVvcRyk0G0MAzh5oKMLb6rTW&index=2).
